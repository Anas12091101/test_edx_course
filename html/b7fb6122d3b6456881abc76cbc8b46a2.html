<p>Before moving your car make sure that it's very safe for you and for the other people around. Be very careful of the traffic behind you; if you have to move to right or left, use your indicators and if any vehicle wants to overtake you, give him way. </p>

<p>Drive to very left side of the road unless you have to turn to the other side or while overtaking. Do not stick on the middle track.</p>
<p>Do not drive that fast that it gets difficult for you to stop in your way (where suitable) even though the road is very clear. While diving have a good distance so that you can stop your can of sudden (if needed). </p>

<p>If you feel sleepy or any irritation in your eyes due to any reason then slow down or stop your car at the very left side of the road.</p>
<p>If the road in under construction then drive slow and carefully. </p>

<p>Be very careful at such turns where itâ€™s difficult to see any other car moving/coming from the either sides. Also be very careful at the deep or sudden turns.</p>
