<p>Do not overtake until and unless you are sure that you yourself and others will be safe by your act. Be very careful while overtaking in rainy weather, dense foggy weather etc because it is very difficult to judge your distance and speed in such weather conditions. </p>

<p>Do not overtake when you are on a turn, corner, intersecting road, any mountain peak or near it, on a narrow road or by your overtake the other driver gets nervous or had to apply his brakes, or when any vehicle slows down to let the pedestrian or to any traffic pass or stops for parking. </p>
<p>Except when the driver is signaled to turn right, always overtake from the right side. It's not necessary to follow these principle when on roundabout, or on turns or on the one way road. Don't move in a speed from your track to the middle of the road or (if) before doing so you have to inform first. Do not come of sudden in front of any such moving vehicle to which you just have overtaken. Unless you are satisfied to have clear road in front of you. Do not cross the continuous white line on the road; if it is a traffic jam then be in your lane.</p>
<p> Reduce your speed when you see the ‘Reduce Speed’ sign board near any intersecting road and be prepared to stop when the point comes. First look to the right side then to the left and again to the right side when you are on the intersecting road and do not move until you are satisfied that it's safe to move.</p>
<p>Give way to them main road traffic on the intersection. If you are doubtful regarding the main road (if it is a main road or not) even then give way to vehicle on that road.</p>
<p>Reduce your speed after you see the ‘Railway level crossing’ sign. Look to the right and left side and listen carefully before crossing the line.</p>
