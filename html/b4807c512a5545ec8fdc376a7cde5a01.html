<p> If  the road carries two type of lines i.e continuous and discontinuous then be conscious that on which track you are. If it is a continuous line then do not change your track or overtake as long as you are driving in this particular track. When the discontinuous line starts then you can change your track and can overtake but it should be done before the next continuous line starts, overtaking must be after all precautions and must be very safe. On such a road which is divided by the lines; you are supposed to select your way and be in your lane until it's very necessary to change.</p>
